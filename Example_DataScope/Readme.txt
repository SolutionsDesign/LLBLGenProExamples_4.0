		<h2>LLBLGen Pro Data Scope example Adapter/Selfservicing.</h2>
		This example shows the usage of the Data Scope feature, which was first introduced in LLBLGen Pro v4.
		The example combines adapter and selfservicing code in one application, to illustrate the differences between
	the two with respect to Data Scopes.

It requires the SqlServer Northwind database to run.
To make it run on your system, change the connection string in the App.config file to make the code be able to access your
SqlServer instance with the Northwind database.
		<br /><br />
	The Data Scopes are defined in the Northwind.BO project. The example also illustrates 're-parenting' with a specific scope.
	Be aware that the application will save changes to your database. If you want to keep your northwind database in-tact, first
	make a copy. 
		<br />
	The CustomerManagerUsingBO forms illustrate the actual power of the scope: there's almost no code, yet the forms are feature rich: 
	they manage data for customer, its orders and the order lines, you can edit the data, add new data and persist the changes, including
	deletes. It also illustates how to enable a save button based on changes detected by the scope.
		<br />
		<br>
		<br>
		You can see which queries LLBLGen Pro produces and which calls are made by switching on tracing: open App.Config in the GUI project 
	and switch on one 
or more of the trace switches in the file (enable the DQE tracing switch to view queries). Recompile and run the application in debug mode, you'll see
the queries and other tracing output in the Output window of Visual Studio.NET.
